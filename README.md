# Simple-Steemit-Delegation
I made a simple steemit delegation tool in javascript, that can be run within your own browser, your computer or github pages. This tool uses steemconnect, and your personal details are only entered on steemconnect.com. Please make sure to double check that the URL starts with: "https://steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegator="



# How do i run this?

### Clone this repo
Once cloned open the index.html file.

### Github Pages (Easiest way)
This is hosted on Github pages, and can be found here: https://fhald.dk/Simple-Steemit-Delegation/.

### Directly in your browser
The good thing about JavaScript is that it can run inside of your browser. Open the developer console (F12) and copy/paste the code between <script> and </script>
